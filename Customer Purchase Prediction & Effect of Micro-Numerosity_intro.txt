Introduction to the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Customer Purchase dataset, which contains information about different customers and their purchasing behavior. It includes the following columns:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
Education: Education level of the customer (School, UG, PG).
Review: Customer's review rating (Poor, Average, Good).
Purchased: Indicates if the customer made a purchase (Yes/No).
The dataset contains 50 entries, with each entry representing a specific customer and their attributes.

Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to determine whether a customer will make a purchase based on their demographic and review information. The project involves the following steps:

Data Import and Initial Exploration: Load the dataset and explore its basic properties such as shape, data types, and summary statistics.
Feature Selection and Target Definition: Identify the target variable (Purchased) and select relevant features (Age, Gender, Education, Review) for the predictive model.
Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical variables for model compatibility.
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Model Selection: Choose a Random Forest Classifier for prediction.
Model Training: Train the model on the training data.
Prediction and Evaluation: Use the trained model to predict customer purchases on the test data and evaluate the model's performance using metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.
